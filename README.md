# Package description
Hi im just here to trigger the workflow

---

# Implementation
The parser/lexer code is generated using [*ANTLR4*](https://www.antlr.org/). Once the AST has been generated, the 
package generates a nested structure tree using [*gRPC*](https://grpc.io/) messages. The idea behind this is to provide 
the AST to any client written in [*any language*](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) with a well documented, supported and
structured message structure.

---

# Example
Let say you must parse the following A2L content using *Python*:
```
ASAP2_VERSION 1 51
/begin PROJECT my_project_name "my_project_long_id"
/end PROJECT
```
## Getting the pre-built artefacts
The fist thing to do is to retrieve the pre-built artefacts from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/Sauci/a2l-grpc/releases). To do so, follow 
[this link](https://github.com/Sauci/a2l-grpc/releases/latest) and download the file named *a2l_grpc.tar.gz*. This 
archive contains the following files/directories:
```
a2l_grpc.tar.gz
├── protobuf
|   ├── A2L.proto
|   ├── A2ML.proto
|   ├── API.proto
|   ├── IF_DATA.proto
|   ├── shared.proto
├── a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).h
├── a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).dll
└── a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).so
```
The *a2l_grpc.tar.gz/protobuf* folder contains all the *gRPC* data structure definitions. It will be used to generate
the structures definitions, as well as their serialization/deserialization method for the desired language (*Python* in
this case).

The a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).h contains the API definition of the corresponding *Dynamic Link Library*/*Shared Object*.

Finally, the a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).dll/so serves this API.

## Integrating the pre-built artefacts
Now that we have the artefacts, we need to integrate them into the *Python* project. Simply extract the archive and 
place it into the project to have the following files/directories structure:
```
src
├── a2l_grpc
|   ├── protobuf
|   |   ├── A2L.proto
|   |   ├── A2ML.proto
|   |   ├── API.proto
|   |   ├── IF_DATA.proto
|   |   ├── shared.proto
|   ├── a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).h
|   ├── a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).dll
|   └── a2l_grpc_(os)_(arch).so
├── main.py
```
## Generating the *gRPC* sources
The next step is to generate the *gRPC* source for our language, in this case *Python*. To do that, we first need to 
install the code generator for *Python* with the command `python -m pip install grpcio-tools`

Then, we generate the sources with the following command (running from the *src* directory):

`python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./a2l_grpc --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ./a2l_grpc/protobuf/*.proto`

This command will create a *protobuf* directory in the *src* folder, containing all the *Python* sources.

## Writing the *gRPC* client
Now that all sources are available, we can start writing the *gRPC* client in *Python*. Here is the code:
```python
import ctypes
import os

from pya2l.protobuf.API_pb2 import *
from pya2l.protobuf.API_pb2_grpc import *


def get_shared_object_name() -> str:
    if os.name == 'nt':
        shared_object = 'a2l_grpc_windows_amd64.dll'
    elif os.name == 'posix':
        shared_object = 'a2l_grpc_linux_amd64.so'
    else:
        raise Exception(f'unsupported operating system {os.name}')
    return shared_object


class A2lParser(object):
    def __init__(self, string):
        self._dll = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'a2l_grpc', get_shared_object_name()))
        channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:3333')
        client = A2LStub(channel)
        if self._dll.Create(3333):
            raise Exception(1)
        self.ast = client.GetTreeFromA2L(TreeFromA2LRequest(a2l=string.encode())).tree


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a2l_string = """ASAP2_VERSION 1 51
/begin PROJECT my_project_name "my_project_long_id"
/end PROJECT"""

    p = A2lParser(a2l_string)
    print(f'ASAP2 version number = {p.ast.ASAP2_VERSION.VersionNo.Value}')
    print(f'ASAP2 upgrade number = {p.ast.ASAP2_VERSION.UpgradeNo.Value}')
    print(p.ast)
```
Running this code will produce the following output:
```
ASAP2 version number = 1
ASAP2 upgrade number = 51
ASAP2_VERSION {
  VersionNo {
    Value: 1
    Base: 10
    Size: 1
  }
  UpgradeNo {
    Value: 51
    Base: 10
    Size: 2
  }
}
PROJECT {
  Name {
    Value: "my_project_name"
  }
  LongIdentifier {
    Value: "my_project_long_id"
  }
}
```

# Hints
- As A2L files are often quite large, it might happen that *gRPC* raise an error because the message size is too large. 
  In order to fix that, it is possible to set `grpc.max_receive_message_length` and `grpc.max_send_message_length` 
  options while instantiating the *gRPC* channel.
- As shown in the above example, the numerical values are held in the *Value* field. The other fields are holding meta-
  data in case the value must be dumped. In the case of the *UpgradeNo* for instance, the *Base* field says that the
  original value was defined in numerical base 10, and the *Size* field says that it has 2 digits.
